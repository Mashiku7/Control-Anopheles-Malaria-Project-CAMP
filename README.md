# Control-Anopheles-Malaria-Project-CAMP
Our HackMIT 2018 Project, created to serve as a base for creating a Q-learning Reinforcement Learning Model, using tensor-flow to decrease Anopheles mosquito density with  actions determined by our trained agent. The project at MIT is the initial step that uses ARIMA to create a time-series to forecast Anopheles Density over a year in the Muleba, Kagera, Tanzania region.
